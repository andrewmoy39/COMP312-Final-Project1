Testing procedure:
-------------------
1. Test every button with the regular numbers
2. Test every button using the Pi and e buttons
3. Test the Pi and e buttons to make sure they do not stack in the text editor with ANY other number
4. Test all buttons with inputs that are both integers, and doubles to make sure they are compatible.
5. Any undefined functions do not give results, nor infinity

Tests:
9*8=72
sin(90) = 1
cos(90) = ~0
tan(90) = undefined(no output)
15MOD8 = 7.0
7^2 = 49
1/7 = 0.1428...
log(1/7) = -0.845...
e^4 = 54.5981....
log(8!!) = infinity
3*10^8 - speed of light - Press 3, press *, press 8, press 10^x, press =, = c



Bugs:
------------
- factorials will crash if you press the button when the number is alreayd infinity
- the binary of infinity is just 1111111111111111111111111111111 which is int.MAX_VALUE
